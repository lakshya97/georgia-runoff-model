# georgia-runoff-model
A model that computes runoff margins by projecting the November electorate split by precinct onto current totals.

To run this, create a subfolder called "Absentee Files", download the voter absentee file from https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/voterabsenteefile.do, and move it into that subdirectory.
